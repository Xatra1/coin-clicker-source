To play the game, simply download the source code from the latest release or get the latest (and possibly unstable!) version by typing the following commands into a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Xatra1/coin-clicker-source.git
cd coin-clicker-source
```
This will put you into the folder that contains "index.html", which is how you will open the game.
