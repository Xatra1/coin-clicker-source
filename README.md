# Browser Compatibility 
**This game is not compatible with Internet Explorer. Support is not planned.**  
  
Opera and Microsoft Edge do not support the canvas drawing (used to divide sections of the game's interface with borders) that this game utilizes. A potential fallback for these browsers is planned, but for now, you may need to use a different browser.  
  
Chrome users are advised to disable the bookmarks bar from showing up in tabs, to stop text from being cut off at the bottom of the screen. The game otherwise performs just fine, with everything working as expected.  
  
Firefox works perfectly, with the exception of being unable to accurately identify your OS name. It will instead default to general names like "Windows" or "Linux."  
  
**Note: This game only officially supports 1920x1080 and 1366x768 resolutions, and is designed to display properly mostly on Linux systems.**  
  
# About
Coin Clicker is a web-based clicker game inspired by idle games like Cookie Clicker. It was originally made using [code.org](https://code.org)'s App Lab libraries, before I got frustrated with the limitations of the site's functions and rebuilt the game from the ground up using (mostly) pure JavaScript. The original project only made it to Beta v4, before Beta v5, codenamed "Rewrite," was moved over to GitHub. This project has since far surpassed the progress of the original code.org game and has gotten far more work put into it.  

You can download the latest stable release of the game from the Releases tab, or use the Coin Clicker Release Tool [here](https://github.com/Xatra1/coin-clicker-release-tool) to make a release with the latest (and potentially unstable!) code.  
  
Or, if you don't want to bother with that, you can also play the game [here.](https://xatra1.github.io/coin-clicker-source) (Note that this uses the latest version of the code by default and may also be unstable.)
