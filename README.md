To play the game, simply download the source code from any release or get the newest (and possibly unstable!) code by typing the following commands into a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Xatra1/coin-clicker-source.git
cd coin-clicker-source
```
This will put you into the folder that contains "index.html", which is how you will open the game.  
  
Or, if you don't want to bother with that, you can also play the game [here.](https://xatra1.github.io/coin-clicker-source) (Note that this uses the latest version of the code by default and may also be unstable.)
  
Icons made by Font Awesome, with the exception of the (currently unused) "octillionachievements.png", which is made by IconsMind.  
Sound effects obtained from Pixabay.  
  
Note: Saves are not compatible between different versions of the game. If you attempt to play a newer version of the game with an older save, it will not load.
