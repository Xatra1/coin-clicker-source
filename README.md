You can download the latest stable release of the game from the Releases tab, or use the Coin Clicker Release Tool [here](https://github.com/Xatra1/coin-clicker-release-tool) to make a release with the latest (and potentially unstable!) code.  
  
Or, if you don't want to bother with that, you can also play the game [here.](https://xatra1.github.io/coin-clicker-source) (Note that this uses the latest version of the code by default and may also be unstable.)

~~Note: Saves are not compatible between different versions of the game. If you attempt to play a newer version of the game with an older save, it will not load.~~ This is no longer true, however all saves created prior to the release of build 3.8ab will not load in newer releases of the game.
