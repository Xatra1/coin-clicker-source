Build 4.5ab
- Added the Clicker Fusion, an upgrade which requires 150 clickers to unlock and obtain, and will multiply the CPS of all of your current clickers by 150%.
- Fixed several bugs when buying items from the shop while buffs were active as well (for real this time) and a bug with your CPS retaining its doubled status when saving and reloading. (This bug also occurred with the click value buff.)
- Modified some of the shop prices to make them much more early-game friendly.
- *Finally* removed the coin's background.
- The item unlocked string no longer displays achievement unlocks after initially loading data.
- Greatly increased the speed at which values update.
- Added a feature that automatically buys shop items whenever you have enough clicks to buy anything.
- Fixed audio.
- Added a loading screen.
- The info labels for shop items are now aligned with the shop panel's border rather than the position of the cursor, making them easier to read. 
- The achievements and settings button labels are now centered.
- Removed the source code note at the top of the title screen.
- The info labels for regular shop items now display "You have no [item]." if that item is worth no CpS.
- Decreased the amount of clickers required to unlock the double pointer from 75 to 50.
- Made saving work more consistently. Before, clicking the save button did not always work thanks to some variables being at the wrong values, even when the game was ready to save.
- Changed the name of the secret achievement.
- The title of the page now dynamically changes to match your click count, or will say "A buff is active!" if one occurs.
- The game will no longer automatically create a save if one does not exist.
- The game will now remember that you entered a correct key and bypass the key input screen when accessing the debug console output.
- Your raw CpS and raw click value are now displayed in the stats panel.
- Reworked the way saving works to allow for price changes to take effect on items you have not yet unlocked in future updates.
- The debug console can now interpret a few commands, run 'help' for more info. (Currently does not display properly on 1366x768, this will be fixed in the future.)

Notes and Extra Changes: 
- Your save WILL BE ERASED when opening this version of the game due to format inconsistencies.
- I am currently working on making namespaces for the game's variables. Expect things to break in the next few releases!
- You can no longer save when a buff is occurring due to how the shop now handles buffs when calculating CpS values and prices after buying items.
- Everything in the main code is no longer one big function, making all variables global. Much easier to debug!
- Removed a reference to update 5 that was being logged in the console.
- Your click value will no longer get updated during a double CpS buff. It will update when the buff ends. (This is a side effect of the buff fixes for the shop)
- Autobuy cannot buy the Clicker Fusion.

And with that, Update 6 is now complete.
Yeah, I know I didn't add a lot of the stuff I had originally planned, but I decided to significantly polish the game before doing that. The *true* content update will happen soon. 
Meanwhile, in Update 7, otherwise known as the "Movement" update, I plan to add the following:

- Animations for things like the coin and shop items.
- Lots of bug fixes and balancing.
- And maybe some other things.
