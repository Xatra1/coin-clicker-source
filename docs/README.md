# About
Coin Clicker is a web-based clicker game inspired by idle games like Cookie Clicker. It was originally made using [code.org](https://code.org)'s App Lab libraries, before I got frustrated with the limitations of the site's functions and rebuilt the game from the ground up using (mostly) pure JavaScript. The original project only made it to Beta v4, before Beta v5, codenamed "Rewrite," was moved over to GitHub. This project has since far surpassed the progress of the original code.org game and has gotten far more work put into it.  

# Download
You can get any stable release of the game from the Releases tab on the right. Simply pick the version you want, and click 'Source code (zip)'  
The game is also available for play [here.](https://coin-clicker.surge.sh)  
If you want to get a **legacy** release of the game (a build that came out prior to build 3.11rb), check [here.](https://github.com/Xatra1/coin-clicker-archive)  
  
**Note:** If you are playing on a platform that says 'Undetected' in the string below the start button, please use the tool [here](https://coincompatdbgr.surge.sh) (source code for this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/Xatra1/coin-clicker-compatibility-debugger)) to determine whether your platform supports userAgentData (denoted by the 'true/false' at the top of the screen when launching the game) and your userAgentString (displayed at the bottom of the screen after the animations have finished). Afterwards, file an issue including a screenshot of those two items and a possible detection fix will then be implemented.
