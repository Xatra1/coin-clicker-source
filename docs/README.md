# About
Coin Clicker is a web-based clicker game inspired by idle games like Cookie Clicker. It was originally made using [code.org](https://code.org)'s App Lab libraries, before I got frustrated with the limitations of the site's functions and rebuilt the game from the ground up using (mostly) pure JavaScript. The original project only made it to Beta v4, before Beta v5, codenamed "Rewrite," was moved over to GitHub. This project has since far surpassed the progress of the original code.org game and has gotten far more work put into it.
