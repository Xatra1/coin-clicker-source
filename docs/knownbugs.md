~~- Buffs can occur twice in a row. (Not strictly a bug, but unintended behavior)~~
- ~~! The debug console no longer accepts Base64 keys.~~
- ! Unlocking the 'Cheater' achievement shows the Breaking Point achievement in the menu.
- ! The game's BGM cannot loop more than once before it fails to play again.
